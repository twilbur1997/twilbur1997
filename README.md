- 👋 Hi, I’m @twilbur1997
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and AI, mostly architecting on AWS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cook spare ribs, short ribs, and korean BBQ ribs - life's not all about coding!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something you want to learn, whether AWS, command line, web scraping, or something else
- 📫 How to reach me: wilburtw@amazon.com
